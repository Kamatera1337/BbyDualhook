# BbyDualhook

Bby Stealer is a dualhooked stealer based on PirateStealer and we all know that. This script sends massive requests to annoy brunoxkd on his dualhook server, which by the way, after decompiling and analysing the malware we have seen that it is separated by channels and connects to a totally different api.
